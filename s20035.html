<p id="one" >Josh had spent year and year accumulating the information.
 He knew it inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the field, 
 Josh would be the one to call. The problem was that there was nobody interested in the
 information besides him and he knew it. Years of information painstakingly memorized and 
 sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic.</p>
 
 <p id="two"><i>I've rented a car in Las Vegas and have reserved a hotel in Twentynine Palms which
 is just north of Joshua Tree. We'll drive from Las Vegas through Mojave National Preserve
 and possibly do a short hike on our way down. Then spend all day on Monday at Joshua Tree.
 We can decide the next morning if we want to do more in Joshua Tree or Mojave before we head back.</i></p>

 <p id="four"><strong> The shoes had been there for as long as anyone could remember. In fact, it was difficult for
 anyone to come up with a date they had first appeared. It had seemed they'd always been there and
 yet they seemed so out of place. Why nobody had removed them was a question that had been asked time
 and again, but while they all thought it, nobody had ever found the energy to actually do it. So, the
 shoes remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but perfectly normal in another.<strong></p>
